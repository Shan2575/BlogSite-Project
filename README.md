# BlogSite

### Final project for the Full-Stack Web Development Course at Dublin Coding School. Simple blog-posting website where users can sign up to create an account and post blogs. Blogs contain written stories and pictures can be attached. Once logged in, a user can visit the home page where they can view other user's blogs. Built with PHP, HTML, CSS and SQL. The link to the site can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://blogsiteproject.infinityfreeapp.com/">here.</a>
